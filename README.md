# AMPTemplates
A repository holding my templates for CubeCoders AMP.


## Installation
Download the 3 files (bedrock.kvp, bedrockconfig.json and bedrockmetaconfig.json), and place them in the ADS GenericTemplates folder, which can be found at `Plugins/ADSModule/GenericTemplates`.
Place them there and restart your ADS server. The next time you create an instance there's another option in the Application list named `Bedrock`.

### Note for Windows users
Since the server software requires Visual C++ redistributables, you can download those here: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe 
I've chosen not to include them
